This .unitypackage file works on both unity 2019 and unity 2022. It may work on more but I have not tested it further than that.

The .unitypackage file is the base files that you can import into unity so that you can add them to your item as a dependency.

Usage of these shaders is covered in a basic format in a text file included in the .unitypackage file.
